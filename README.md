# Algorithms1
## introduction
In the Algorithms 1 course at Ariel University we study a number of algorithms.
this project brings all the implementations of this course.

### AliceBob:
The problem Alice and Bob represent a problem where two players play a guessing game in which they have
to toss a coin and guess what came out of the toss to the other player, this algorithm brings all the possibilities 
for the success of the game.

### MinMaxAlgorithms:
In this algorithm I bring all the good and least good options to find minimum and maximum in the array.

### ParkingProblem:
In this problem I bring an algorithm for counting cars in a circular parking lot when we do not know where we started the count.

### Rabbit_Tertel:
In this algorithm we check whether a particular list is circular or not.

### LinkedList_withArm:
In this algorithm we check if a particular list has a non-circular start and a circular end.
