# Algorithms1
## introduction
In the Algorithms 1 course at Ariel University we study a number of algorithms.
this project brings all the implementations of this course.

### AliceBob:
The problem Alice and Bob represent a problem where two players play a guessing game in which they have
to toss a coin and guess what came out of the toss to the other player, this algorithm brings all the possibilities 
for the success of the game.

### MinMaxAlgorithms:
In this algorithm I bring all the good and least good options to find minimum and maximum in the array.

### ParkingProblem:
In this problem I bring an algorithm for counting cars in a circular parking lot when we do not know where we started the count.

### Rabbit_Tertel:
In this algorithm we check whether a particular list is circular or not.

### LinkedList_withArm:
In this algorithm we check if a particular list has a non-circular start and a circular end.

### Recursion_loop:
This class gives some examples of functions realized by recursion or loop, and their priority.

### NumberGameProblem:
 This class represents the problem of numbers game, where players are given an even array of numbers and in each turn 
 they can take either the outer left or the outer right, the winner is the one whose sum of numbers is the largest.
 
 ### MedianProblem:
 This algorithm is divided into two parts:
* Algorithm for solving a median problem in which the user receives an array and has to return an organ larger than the median.
* An algorithm for solving the median problem in which the user receives two sorted arrays and must return an array with all the larger safflowers from the common median to the two combined arrays.
